Pizza Licious

Pizza Licious is a simple yet visually appealing pizza ordering website created using HTML and CSS. Although it does not currently feature a backend database or JavaScript functionality, it provides a basic demonstration of the user interface and layout for a pizza ordering platform. The database schema has been visually represented using MS Access to showcase the potential integration of a backend system for handling orders, customer information, and menu items.

Key Features:

Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
Intuitive Layout: The user interface is thoughtfully organized, making it easy for customers to browse the menu and place orders.
Visual Representation of Database: While there's no active database integration, the project includes a visual representation of the database schema using MS Access, laying the groundwork for future development and integration.
Customizable: Developers can expand upon this project by implementing JavaScript functionalities for dynamic interactions and integrating a backend database system to handle orders and customer data.
Technologies Used:

HTML
CSS
MS Access (for database schema representation)
Future Enhancements:

Integration of JavaScript for dynamic functionalities such as order submission validation and menu filtering.
Backend development for database integration to handle orders, customer information, and menu items.
Implementation of additional features like user authentication, order tracking, and customization options for pizzas.
This project serves as a starting point for aspiring developers interested in building their own online ordering platforms or learning about web development technologies. Contributions and feedback are welcome to further enhance the functionality and usability of Pizza Licious.
